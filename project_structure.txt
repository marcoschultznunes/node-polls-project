1 vote per user: TODO

=> Adding 1 vote per user restriction would require implementing authentication and 
authorization, so i opted not to implement it for the test. However, it could be added by
creating an users entity, adding signup and login, and saving the polls in which the 
user voted as an attribute of the user in the database.
